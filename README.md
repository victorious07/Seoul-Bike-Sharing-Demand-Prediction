Seoul_Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction 
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

**Conclusions:**

* Bike rental count is mostly correlated with the time of the day as it is peak at 8 am morning and 6 pm at evening.

* We observed that bike rental count is high during working days than non-working day.

* We see that people generally prefer to bike at moderate to high temperatures and when little windy.

* It is observed that highest number bike rentals counts in Autumn & Summer  seasons & the lowest in winter and spring season. 

* We observed that the highest number of  bike rentals on a clear day and the lowest on a snowy or rainy day and also  increasing humidity, the number of   bike rental counts decreases.
